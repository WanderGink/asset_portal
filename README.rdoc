== README

This Ruby on Rails app is currently in progress, but it will eventually be a fully functional asset management portal app using Neo4j.

This app also goes along with the `neo4j` gem screencast series by Brian Underwood.

Each episode has a git tag to refer to the final code result so that you can check out and play with the code.
